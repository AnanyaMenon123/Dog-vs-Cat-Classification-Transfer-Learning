# Dog-vs-Cat-Classification-Transfer-Learning
MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It is an extension of the original MobileNet architecture, which was developed by Google. 
The objective of this project is to use Transfer Learning where this model, trained on one task , is put to use on a similar task, using a smaller dataset.
Using this, we classify whether the input image is a cat or a dog after the pre-trained model is trained on number of classes.
A predictive system is later developed, where we classify the input image as a cat or a dog, the model having never seen the input image before
